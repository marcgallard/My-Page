  Hi, my name's Marco and I'm an automation engineer. As well as automating systems I also have experience visualizing data (currently focusing on geospatial data), designing and coding ETL processes/workflows, designing and setting up databases with MySql and MongoDB, data science work (including a case study in R on my Kaggle's page + a certificate I earned from Google's Data Analytics course on Coursera), and cybersecurity (I worked as a security engineer and took some security courses, one of which was a networking & security admin 15-week course that led to attaining Security+ and IT Fundaments+ certificates from CompTIA). I have worked at a number of companies, gaining teamwork and leadership skills in the process.

  I am most skilled in: <mark>Python</mark>, <mark>APIs</mark>, <mark>Data structures</mark>, and <mark>Scientific computing</mark>

          I started this project as a way of refreshing my <mark>Python</mark> skills and to practice visualizing data, particularly geospatial data as I've never worked with it before. I have learned a few new skills through this, such as creating a dashboard on Tableau Public. Please feel free to play around with it, the link is posted on the repo page!

          This was originally a response to a coding question given by a job I applied to in the past. The goal was to create a BMI calculator in <mark>Python</mark> to accept basic health data of several patients in JSON format which can then be used to determine their BMI, its respective category, and associated health risk. The inclusion of a JSON schema and BMI table allows flexibility for how the code can be used.
